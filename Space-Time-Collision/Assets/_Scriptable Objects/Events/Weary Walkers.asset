    again. '

  - 'You let the team know they''ve earned a rest. The thank you and quickly turn
    in for the night. While they rest you hear the natives of the world wander, multiply,
    and mutate. Your kindness may reveal itself to be a cruelity.

    regains 20 HP and 8 SP, but future encounters are more dangerous.] '
  - 'You let the team know they have an hour to use as they see fit. Nobody wastes
    time thanking you, they simply drop their gear and do their best to rest. They''re
    spry when the rest ends, but so are the foes that have encroached.


    [The
    party regains 8 HP, but enemies begin the next combat with Block I.] '
  - 'You simply say, "March on. You can stop when you''re dead". The team talks back
    and you ignore them. They can hate you all they want, but they will live to do
    so.
