  eventDescription: As your squad travels the through the dense tangle of mushrooms
    that dominates the reality's surface you sense a powerful magic aura. When they
    investigate they find the source of the aura is surrounded by clearly poisonous
    fauna, and the corpses of other travelers.
  eventOptions:
  - 'No risk, no reward. Take the relic.

'
  - A little bit of body looting never hurt anyone, right? Loot the corpses.
  - Better to learn from their mistakes. Leave.
  eventResults:
  - 'You order the team to navigate the fauna and secure the Talisman. They don''t
    protest, but you sense their hesistation and eventually their frustration as
    their lungs fill with the noxious fumes. They do manage to secure the relic,
    which is what truly matters.


    [Gain a random Talisman. The party begins
    the next combat with Poison IV] '
  - 'You order the team to take what they can from the corpses and leave. They move
    quickly, but not so quick as to avoid the fumes. As soon the gear is secured
    thea team abandons the site, albeit a bit worse for wear.


    [+10 Gold, gain
    a random Consumable, and -5 HP to the party.]'
  - 'Your order the team to leave it alone. They don''t protest, moving quickly and
    carefully from the scene. You hope this gruesome scene will inspire caution in
    the hours to come.


    [A random ally begins the next combat with Dodge II] '
